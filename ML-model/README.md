# Linear Regression using TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates how to perform linear regression using TensorFlow.js and visualize the results with Chart.js. The example includes generating synthetic data, training a simple linear regression model, making predictions, and updating the chart with the predicted values.

## Introduction

This project showcases a basic implementation of linear regression using TensorFlow.js. It includes a user interface for entering input values to predict the output using the trained model. The results are visualized using Chart.js, allowing users to see the data points and the regression line.

## Features

- **Train a Linear Regression Model**: Generate synthetic data and train a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow.js.
- **Predict Values**: Enter input values to get predictions from the trained model.
- **Visualize Data and Predictions**: Plot the initial data points and the regression line using Chart.js, and update the chart with new predictions.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The simplest form, simple linear regression, models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The equation has the form `y = mx + b`, where:
- `y` is the dependent variable.
- `x` is the independent variable.
- `m` is the slope of the line (the rate of change of `y` with respect to `x`).
- `b` is the y-intercept (the value of `y` when `x` is 0).

Linear regression is widely used in various fields for prediction and forecasting.

## What is TensorFlow.js?

TensorFlow.js is an open-source library developed by Google for running machine learning models directly in the browser or in Node.js. It allows you to develop and train machine learning models using JavaScript and deploy them in web applications, making it accessible to web developers who want to integrate AI and machine learning capabilities into their projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a web browser with internet access.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kushalac/javascript-wizardry.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd javascript-wizardry/ML-model
    ```
3. Open the `LinearRegression-using-TensorFlow.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the `LinearRegression-using-TensorFlow.html` file in your web browser.
2. Wait for the model to be trained. You will see the initial data points and the regression line plotted on the chart.
3. Enter an input value in the provided input field.
4. Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted output for the entered input value.
5. The predicted output will be displayed, and the chart will be updated with the new prediction point.
