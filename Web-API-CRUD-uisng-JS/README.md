## Introduction

This project showcases basic CRUD operations using a Web API. It includes forms and buttons for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user data. The user data is fetched from a mock API, and the results are displayed on the web page.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new users by entering a name and clicking the "Create" button.
- **Read**: Fetch and display all users by clicking the "Read All" button.
- **Update**: Update a user's name by entering the user's ID and new name, and clicking the "Update" button.
- **Delete**: Delete a user by entering the user's ID and clicking the "Delete" button.

## What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or an application:

- **Create**: Adding new data to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieving data from the database.
- **Update**: Modifying existing data in the database.
- **Delete**: Removing data from the database.

CRUD operations are fundamental to any application that interacts with a database, allowing users to manage data effectively.

## What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

In this project, we use a Web API to perform CRUD operations on user data. A Web API typically uses HTTP requests to interact with a server, allowing clients (like our web application) to access and manipulate data stored on the server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a web browser with internet access.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kushalac/javascript-wizardry.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd javascript-wizardry/Web-API-using-JS
    ```
3. Open the `web-API.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the `web-API.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the "Create" form to add new users by entering a name and clicking the "Create" button.
3. Click the "Read All" button to fetch and display all users.
4. Use the "Update" form to update a user's name by entering the user's ID and new name, and clicking the "Update" button.
5. Use the "Delete" form to delete a user by entering the user's ID and clicking the "Delete" button.
